"Dear Aliens,
We humans from Earth are very interested in your kind. We have no intentions to harm you and your species; 
in fact, we would be enlightened to learn more about you, and to interact with you someday.
Our world is in turmoil and we would really like your help.
Just like you, we are intellegent beings that love technology, have traveled in space, and are curious.
We want to meet you. We want your wisdom. We want to learn how to not destory our beloved planet.
Earth is a very habitable place, that has water and plants, but is slowly withering away.
We want to know how you can survive without these resources.
If there is anyway you can contact us back, we humans would be forever grateful."
